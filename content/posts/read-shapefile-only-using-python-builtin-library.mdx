Shapefile is open source, well, sort of. ESRI did not provide any tool to read it easily, 
but at least it provided the technical 
[specification](https://www.esri.com/content/dam/esrisites/sitecore-archive/Files/Pdfs/library/whitepapers/pdfs/shapefile.pdf). 
So it won't be so hard to write our own library that reads binary from it and convert it to some format 
that is more friendly.  
In the blog, I will try to use python's built in library to read shapefile, and convert it to Geojson. 
So we can use it in our web application.
A Shapefile usually contains three files, .shp, .shx, .dbf. The .shp file contains the geometry information,
the .shx file contains the index information, and the .dbf file contains the attribute information.
There maybe be other files,like proj file about map project that is not compulsory and usually exclusively used by ESRI, so we will not try to Read and Convert it.  

Reading through the specification, we can find the shp file is quite intuitive, it only contains one geometry type,
if the geometry type is point, then the record is about a point, if the geometry type is polyline, 
then the record is multiple points that form a the geometry.

The File Header takes up 100 bytes(50 words)
A lot of bytes is reserved and what we need is the file length and the geometry type which 
set at byte 24-27 and byte 32-35 respectively.
one thing we need to notice is that the byte order of file length is big endian, while the byte order of geometry type is little endian. 
after we know the these two crucial information, we can start to read the records.  
Each record Header takes up 8 bytes(4 words), I keep stress **word** cause it's used in the whitepaper extensively, and the Record Content length is variable and specified in the Record Header.  
<Image src='/recordHeader.png' width="718" height="404" alt="Image"/>
Every record Header contains the record number(integer) and the record length(integer), both are big endian that set at byte 0-3 and byte 4-7 respectively.
The record number begins with **1** and increments sequentially. The record length is the length of the record content in 16-bit words.
So each record takes up (2 byte * record length + 8) bytes

shapefile have a lot of types of geometry, but we will only focus on the three most common types, point, polyline and polygon.
A point consists of a pair of double-precision coordinates in the order X,Y.
The record content of point is quite simple, it only contains the x and y coordinate of the point, 
both are double precision floating point number, and both are little endian,

while polyline and polygon contains a list of points;

It also have a bounding box that is used to speed up the rendering process.
A polyline can be divide into multiple parts, each part is a list of points,
We can find the parts info at byte 44~(x-1), x = 44 + 4 * num_parts, the parts section stores the index of the first point of each part respect to
the following points section which is a array of points.  
For example, if the parts section is [0, 3, 5], then the first part is the first three points in the points section.

And what about polygon?
Actually, we can think of polygon as a special case of polyline, 
the only difference is that the last point of the polygon is the same as the first point.  
with thses information, we can start to write our own library to read shapefile's geometry information
