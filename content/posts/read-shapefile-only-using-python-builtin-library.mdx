Shapefile is open source, well, sort of. ESRI did not provide any tool to read it easily, 
but at least it provided the technical 
[specification](https://www.esri.com/content/dam/esrisites/sitecore-archive/Files/Pdfs/library/whitepapers/pdfs/shapefile.pdf). 
So it won't be so hard to write our own library that reads binary from it and convert it to some format 
that is more friendly.  
In the blog, I will try to use python's built in library to read shapefile, and convert it to Geojson. 
So we can use it in our web application.
A Shapefile usually contains three files, .shp, .shx, .dbf. The .shp file contains the geometry information,
the .shx file contains the index information, and the .dbf file contains the attribute information.
There maybe be other files,like proj file about map project that is not compulsory and usually exclusively used by ESRI, so we will not try to Read and Convert it.  

Reading through the specification, we can find the shp file is quite intuitive, it only contains one geometry type,
if the geometry type is point, then the record is about a point, if the geometry type is polyline, 
then the record is multiple points that form a the geometry.  

<Image src="/shapefile1.png" width="718" height="404" alt="Image" />
The File Header takes up 100 bytes(50 words)
A lot of bytes is reserved and what we need is the file length and the geometry type which 
set at byte 24-27 and byte 32-35 respectively.
one thing we need to notice is that the byte order of file length is big endian, while the byte order of geometry type is little endian. 
after it there are four double precision numbers that represent the bounding box of the shapefile
<Image src="/shapeMain.png" width="718" height="404" alt="Image" />
after we know the these two crucial information, we can start to read the records.  
Each record Header takes up 8 bytes(4 words), I keep stress **word** cause it's used in the whitepaper extensively, and the Record Content length is variable and specified in the Record Header.  
<Image src='/recordHeader.png' width="718" height="404" alt="Image"/>
Every record Header contains the record number(integer) and the record length(integer), both are big endian that set at byte 0-3 and byte 4-7 respectively.
The record number begins with **1** and increments sequentially. The record length is the length of the record content in 16-bit words.
So each record takes up (2 byte * record length + 8) bytes

shapefile have a lot of types of geometry, but we will only focus on the three most common types, point, polyline and polygon.
A point consists of a pair of double-precision coordinates in the order X,Y.
The record content of point is quite simple, it only contains the x and y coordinate of the point, 
both are double precision floating point number, and both are little endian,

<Image src='/pointStructure.png' width='718' height="404" alt="Image"/>

while polyline and polygon contains a list of points;
<Image src="/polyline.png" width='718' height="404" alt="Image"/>
It also have a bounding box that is used to speed up the rendering process.
A polyline can be divide into multiple parts, each part is a list of points,
We can find the parts info at byte 44~(x-1), x = 44 + 4 * num_parts, the parts section stores the index of the first point of each part respect to
the following points section which is a array of points.  
For example, if the parts section is [0, 3, 5], then the first part is the first three points in the points section.

And what about polygon?
Actually, we can think of polygon as a special case of polyline, 
the only difference is that the last point of the polygon is the same as the first point.  
with thses information, we can start to write our own library to read shapefile's geometry information

First thing first, We need a class to represent the shapefile.
```python
class Shp(object):
    def __init__(self,*agrs):
        #set the path of the first parameter as the path of the shapefile when  Shp is initialized
        self.path=agrs[0] 
        self.shp=None
        #a list to hold file opened, so we can close them later
        self._file_to_close()=[]
        self.shpLength=None
        self.shapeType=None
        self.numShapes=None
        self.shapeName=None
        self.encoding = 'utf-8'
        self.encoding_errors = 'strict'
```
The very first information we need in order to read .shp file is the shp file's header,
So we load the shp file and read the header in the constructor.
```python
class Shp(object):
    def __init__(self,*args)
        ...
        self.load()

    def  load(self,shapeName):
        (shapeName, ext) = os.path.splitext(shapefile)
        self.shapeName = shapeName
        self.load_shp(shapeName)

    def load_shp(self,shapeName):
        self.shp = open("%s.%s" % (shapefile_name, "shp"), "rb")
        self.shx = open("%s.%s" % (shapefile_name, "shx"), "rb")
        self._file_to_close.append(self.shp)
        self._file_to_close.append(self.shx)
        if (self.shp):
            self.load_shp_header()
        if (self.shx):
            self.load_shx_header()
    def load_shp_header(self):
        shp = self.shp
        shp.seek(24)
        # file length big endian
        self.shpLength = unpack(">i", shp.read(4))[0] * 2
        # from word(2 bytes) to byte

        # shape type :little endian
        shp.seek(32)
        #small endian, one integer, 4 bytes
        self.shapeType = unpack("<i", shp.read(4))[0] #unpack returns a tuple,
        #so we need to get the first element of the tuple
        #four double that represent the bounding box
        self.bbox = _Array("d", unpack("<4d", shp.read(32)))
        #two double that represent the z box 
        self.zbox = _Array("d", unpack("<2d", shp.read(16)))
        #two double that represent the m box
        self.mbox = []
        for m in _Array("d", unpack("<2d", shp.read(16))):
            NODATA = -10e38 #according to the whitepaper, number < -10e38 is considered as nodata
            #we can also specify the nodata value at  the top of the file
            if m > NODATA:
                self.mbox.append(m)
            else:
                self.mbox.append(None)
 

```
So the shp's header has been read to memory
We can start to read the content of each feature's geometry
We can return a generator that yields the geometry of each feature,
the generator can be really helpful when we have a large shapefile
```python
# we create a Shape class to represent the geometry and header of each feature
class Shape(object):
    def __init__(
        self,   oid=None
    ):
        #when we init a Shape, we give it oid
        self.shapeType = None
        self.points = []
        self.parts = []
        #we set these public fields so 
        #that we can set it outside the class 
        

        if partTypes:
            self.partTypes = partTypes

        # and a dict to silently record any errors encountered
        self._errors = {}

        # add oid which is the index of the feature in the shapefile
        if oid is not None:
            self.__oid = oid
        else:
            self.__oid = -1
```



we define a method that lazily read the geometry of each feature
by utilizing generator,
the geometry is only read when we need it

```python
class Shp(object):
    ... 

    def iterShapes(self, bbox=None):
        """Returns a generator of shapes in a shapefile. Useful
        for handling large shapefiles.
        To only read shapes within a given spatial region, specify the 'bbox'
        arg as a list or tuple of xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax.
        """
        shp = self.__getFileObj(self.shp)
        # Found shapefiles which report incorrect
        # shp file length in the header. Can't trust
        # that so we seek to the end of the file
        # and figure it out.
        shp.seek(0, 2)
         
        shpLength = shp.tell()
        shp.seek(100)


        # Instead iterate until reach end of file
        # Collect the offset indices during iteration
        i = 0
        offsets = []
        pos = shp.tell()
        while pos < shpLength:
            offsets.append(pos)
            #when we create a Shape, we give it oid
            shape = self.setShapeIndexAndRead(oid=i, )
            #because of the use of generator,
            #the shape is read when each __next__ is called
            pos = shp.tell()
            if shape:
                yield shape
            i += 1
        # Entire shp file consumed
        # Update the number of shapes and list of offsets
        assert i == len(offsets)
        self.numShapes = i
        self._offsets = offsets
    def setShapeIndexAndRead(self, oid=None):


        """Returns the header info and geometry for a single shape."""
        f = self.__getFileObj(self.shp)

        next = f.tell() + (2 * recLength)
        shapeType = unpack("<i", f.read(4))[0]
        single_shape.shapeType = shapeType
        # For Null shapes create an empty points list for consistency
        if shapeType == 0:
            single_shape.points = []

        # All shape types capable of having a bounding box
        elif shapeType in (3, 5, 8, 13, 15, 18, 23, 25, 28, 31):
            single_shape.bbox = _Array("d", unpack("<4d", f.read(32)))

        if shapeType in (3, 5, 8, 13, 15, 18, 23, 25, 28, 31):
            nPoints = unpack("<i", f.read(4))[0]

        if nPoints:

        # definition.  Probably allowed for lazy feature deletion.
        f.seek(next)
        return single_shape    

```
Now we have every shape geometry 
since we are dealing with the point,
polyline,ploygon,we only care about the points and parts of each shape

## the gotcha of shapefile about *multi*

- GeoJson has a concept of *multi* geometry, like MultiPoint, MultiLineString, MultiPolygon
- Shapefile does not have this concept, but it has a concept of *parts*.
- polygon and polyline both have parts, but that doesn't mean they are *multi* geometry
- and  having multiple parts still does not mean it is a *multi* geometry
- when convert to GeoJson, we have to decide whether it is a *multi* geometry or not by computing the geometry

A part can have one exterior ring and any number of interior rings,
and it's the number of exterior rings that determine whether it is a *multi* geometry or not
## MultiPolygon
<Image src='/Multi.png' width='718' height="404" alt="Image"/>
-----
## Ploygon
<Image src='/NoMulti.png' width='718' height="404" alt="Image"/>



the index in parts section is the index of the first point of each part(exterior or interior line) respect to

1. if there is only one part , then of course it's a polygon or polyline(in the concept of GeoJson)
2. if the number of exterior rings is 1, it's a polygon 
3. if the number of exterior rings is greater than 1, it's a MultiPolygon 


wheter a part is exterior or interior is determined by the winding order of the points in the part

<Image src='/aboutRing.png' width='718' height="404" alt="Image"/>

We can write a function that accept a list of rings and return a list of polygons
this is a very sophisticated function from open source library *pyshp*, it uses other functions like
is_cw, ring_bbox, bbox_contains, ring_sample, ring_contains_point, signed_area
you can find the implementation of these functions in the source code of pyshp
and you can also check the concise code on [my Github](https://github.com/bre01/pyshp)

```python
def organize_polygon_rings(rings, return_errors=None):
    """Organize a list of coordinate rings into one or more polygons with holes.
    Returns a list of polygons, where each polygon is composed of a single exterior
    ring, and one or more interior holes. If a return_errors dict is provided (optional),
    any errors encountered will be added to it.

    Rings must be closed, and cannot intersect each other (non-self-intersecting polygon).
    Rings are determined as exteriors if they run in clockwise direction, or interior
    holes if they run in counter-clockwise direction. This method is used to construct
    GeoJSON (multi)polygons from the shapefile polygon shape type, which does not
    explicitly store the structure of the polygons beyond exterior/interior ring orientation.
    """

the Geojson from converted from shapefile will contain a object
that has a type property that is set to "FeatureCollection" and a features object
that consist of a list of features, each feature has a geometry object and a properties object,and a type property 
that is set to feature

this is the polygon's json structure 
the endless [ and ] can frustrating

```json
{
    "type": "FeatureCollection", 
    "features": [

if the coordinates is like this for every single geometry
```json
"coordinates":[1.0,2.0]

it's a *point*

```
*multipolygon*  that have two polygons  
The first polygon have two rings, the first ring is the exterior ring and the second ring is the interior ring
and the second polygon only has one exterior ring 

the Shape class can be converted to json use the \_\_json__ method
```python
class Shape(object):
    ...
    def __json__(self):
        if self.shapeType=="Point":
            # the point only contains one point
            return {"type": "Point", "coordinates": tuple(self.points[0])}
        elif self.shapeType=="Polyline":
            if len(self.parts) == 0:
                # the shape has no coordinate information, i.e. is 'empty'
                # the geojson spec does not define a proper null-geometry type
                # however, it does allow geometry types with 'empty' coordinates to be interpreted as null-geometries
                return {"type": "LineString", "coordinates": []}
            elif len(self.parts) == 1:
                # linestring
                return {

                    "coordinates": [tuple(p) for p in self.points],
                }
            else:
                # multilinestring

                    else:
                        coordinates.append([tuple(p) for p in self.points[ps:part]])
                        ps = part
                else:
                    coordinates.append([tuple(p) for p in self.points[part:]])

        elif self.shapeType=="Polygon":
            if len(self.parts) == 0:
                # the shape has no coordinate information, i.e. is 'empty'
                # the geojson spec does not define a proper null-geometry type
                # however, it does allow geometry types with 'empty' coordinates to be interpreted as null-geometries
                return {"type": "Polygon", "coordinates": []}
            else:
                # get all polygon rings
                rings = []
                for i in range(len(self.parts)):
                    # get indexes of start and end points of the ring
                    start = self.parts[i]
                    try:
                        end = self.parts[i + 1]
                    except IndexError:
                        end = len(self.points)

                    # extract the points that make up the ring
                    ring = [tuple(p) for p in self.points[start:end]]
                    rings.append(ring)

                # organize rings into list of polygons, where each polygon is defined as list of rings.
                # the first ring is the exterior and any remaining rings are holes (same as GeoJSON).
                polys = organize_polygon_rings(rings, self._errors)
                   
                # return as geojson
                if len(polys) == 1:
                    return {"type": "Polygon", "coordinates": polys[0]}
                else:
                    return {"type": "MultiPolygon", "coordinates": polys}

        else:
            
            raise Exception("Unknown shape type")
```
every Shape instance will be convert to a dict as a feature to be added to the features list
we also set the the properties of each feature to None for now,





```python
class Shp():
    ...
    def iterShapeRecords(self):

        # the number of shape and record should be the same
        # in a typical(correct) shapefile 
        # so we combine dbf attribute and shape into the a shapeRecord
        # but for now we only care about shape so set the record to None
        # the None will be convert to null in json
        for shape in self.iterShapes():
            yield ShapeRecord(shape=shape, record=None)
```
we set a ShapeRecord class to hold the shape and the record
```python 
class ShapeRecord(object):
    """A ShapeRecord object containing a shape along with its attributes.
    Provides the __json__ property to return a Feature dictionary."""

    def __init__(self, shape=None, record=None):
        self.shape = shape
        self.record = record

    # line 493
    @property
    def __json__(self):

        # we don't have properties now, so return properties as null 
        return {
            "type": "Feature",
            "properties": None,
            "geometry": self.shape.__json__
        }
```
So we can wrap the ShapeRecords into a FeatureCollection
```python 
class Shp():
    ...
    def __json__(self):
        """Returns a GeoJSON FeatureCollection representation of the shapefile."""
        return {
            "type": "FeatureCollection",
            "features": [sr.__json__ for sr in self.iterShapeRecords()],
            "bbox": self.bbox,
        }
```
The main function like like this,
We can use json to dump the dict out
```python
a=Shp("test.shp")
geoJson=a.__json__()
with open("test.json","w") as f:
    json.dump(geoJson,f)
```
