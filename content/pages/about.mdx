I'm a GIS student with a deep interest in mathematics, particularly computational geometry, and a passion for computer science, especially system programming. I have a strong understanding of the POSIX API and have completed numerous projects in JavaScript. Additionally, I’m well-versed in GIS frameworks like Leaflet and continuously work on expanding my skills in geospatial technologies. Through my studies and projects, I aim to integrate mathematical concepts with practical applications in geographic information systems and programming

## I love performance !

I have a deep passion for performance optimization, which is why I'm drawn to system-level languages like C++ and Rust. These languages give me the control I need to push hardware to its absolute limits. The satisfaction I get from squeezing out every bit of performance, whether it’s through careful use of SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data), multithreading, or memory optimization, is what drives me. I love the challenge of identifying bottlenecks and fine-tuning code to run more efficiently. The idea of making systems run faster without sacrificing reliability or functionality excites me.

In particular, working with C++ allows me to dig into the low-level aspects of hardware, giving me direct control over memory management and processor instructions. Rust, on the other hand, offers a safer alternative while still maintaining the same level of performance through its strict ownership rules and fearless concurrency. For me, it's all about finding the perfect balance between speed, safety, and control. Every time I see a performance gain—no matter how small—I feel like I've unlocked a new level of efficiency that can have far-reaching effects throughout the entire system."

This blends the original theme of performance optimization with additional elements like memory management and system-level control.

## Decentralized Web is the future 

The web has truly revolutionized how information is accessed and shared, making it available to anyone, anywhere, at any time. It has broken down barriers, enabling global communication, collaboration, and learning at a scale that was unimaginable just a few decades ago. I strongly believe in the future of a decentralized web, where users have more control over their data, privacy is respected, and information is distributed in a more equitable manner. The potential for blockchain and peer-to-peer technologies to reshape the way we interact with the web excites me.

My experience with the V8 engine has deepened my appreciation for the underlying technology that powers modern web browsers and applications. V8’s ability to compile JavaScript into highly efficient machine code allows developers to build fast, responsive applications that can rival native software. This efficiency not only enhances the user experience but also opens up new possibilities for complex web applications. The combination of decentralized architecture and powerful engines like V8 is, to me, the key to unlocking the next wave of innovation on the web.
